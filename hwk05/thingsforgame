List of things to add:

// - Add jump to ‘spacebar’
//- if the user reaches end of map, they win
//	- if not they lose
// - reaching your goal before the time runs out will multiple score by 2x
// - don't reach your goal before the time runs out, multiple score by 0.5x
- when a player hits a coffee cup, charger, or textbook, they get 100 points
- when a player hits a professor, student, or car, they lose 100 points
//	- player must avoid these objects by jumping over them
- if a character hits more than 5 bad objects, they automatically lose
// - bad and good objects will be randomly generated and placed onto the screen
- need to add hit indicators for when a user hits a good or bad object
	- sounds?
	- screen changes color?

// - create function that will randomly generate a number for the timer that when it hits zero will call a function that will generate a random number that will be the key to the item in the array




Stretch goal:

- allow character to move up and down on road to avoid obstacles
