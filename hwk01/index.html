<strong>2048</strong></br></br>

<p>I really like games that have to do with numbers and that require you to recognize patterns in order to figure out how to solve the game. These traits are what make 2048 great. The objective of 2048 is to combine numbers and reach the 2048 tile without running out of the ability to combine tiles. There actually is a strategy to keeping yourself from running out of space in this game, however I won't disclose it for super top secret reasons ;). But once you do figure out this strategy the game becomes more about your ability to keep remembering that strategy and to keep move away from it at all costs. The only downsides I see from this game after playing for so long are that there is no timer in the game, which I think would add a nice level of complexity to it. This would make users have to make sudden actions and have to keep playing the game more and more in order to figure out its secret strategy.</p>

<strong>Dots Mania</strong></br></br>

<p>This game requires you to pay attention to the entire board that you are playing on, so that you can get the best possible score in the set amount of moves. This is what makes this game stand out, because it makes the user go back and check make sure that the move they are making is the best possible one. Also the game has a strong replay ability because the generated board appears to be random so the user can have a bad board one game but have a great one the next game. My reasoning for liking this game is mostly because I like the matching games and the color palette and design of this one is far superior and eye appealing then others that I have played.</p><p>The downsides that I have found are that the game feels like it was made for mobile in that you have to click, hold, and drag other balls in order to select them. This is great for mobile users but I found it more difficult on desktop to grasp that this was what I was suppose to do. And lastly the game option that I was playing on didn't have timer, which would have benefitted my experience by making the game even more difficult and challenging for me to perform correctly due to the time constraints.</p>
